# synratss
This R package was developed by Lowe Wilsson for use at the Center of Neurodevelopmental Disorders at Karolinska Institutet (KIND). It may be used for calculating consistency scores for data from an online consistency test (see e.g. Rothen, Seth, Witzel, & Ward, 2013) and related tasks such as producing plots for each data set/participant. 

__This package has been deprecated__. Its applicability was highly narrow and specific, and is only left here for the sake of documentation. It should not be used for any new analyses. Instead, the more general `synr` package, also developed by Lowe Wilsson and [available on Github](https://github.com/datalowe/synr) implements all the (non-KIND-specific) functionality of synratss and more with a cleaner interface and source code. It also has proper documentation and tests.

If you still want to test some part of synratss, you can use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) to build and install the package by using the source code here. Once you've installed the package, you can find more help by running `help(synratss)` or looking at documentation for a specific function, eg `help(consistency_scoring)`.

If you just want to read about how synratss worked, you can try reading the documentation and code in the 'R' directory's files.
