Description: The main function is consistency_scoring, which uses the other
    functions in the package. It calculates consistency scores for data from
    an online consistency test (see e.g. Rothen, Seth, Witzel, & Ward, 2013)
    and produces plots for each data set/participant. This package was
    developed for use at the Center of Neurodevelopmental Disorders at
    Karolinska Institutet (KIND), under the supervision of Janina Neufeld. Its
    applicability is highly narrow and specific.
