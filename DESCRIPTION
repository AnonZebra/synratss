Title: Handles Data From Synesthesia Consistency Test
Version: 0.1
Author: Lowe Wilsson
Maintainer: Lowe Wilsson <lowe.wilsson@ki.se>
Description: The main function is \code{consistency_scoring()}, which uses the other
    functions in the package. It calculates consistency scores for data from
    an online consistency test (see e.g. Rothen, Seth, Witzel, & Ward, 2013)
    and produces plots for each data set/participant. You can also use the 
    \code{plot_syn_cons()} function on its own (it is otherwise called by the 
    \code{consistency_scoring()} function). The \code{cbind_matches()} function
    is used for combining data frames of different lengths, a common scenario
    working with twins data from different sources where you want to e.g. link 
    entries/rows in one data frame with those of another, using a key variable such as 
    user name or study ID. This package was developed for use at the Center of 
    Neurodevelopmental Disorders at Karolinska Institutet (KIND). Its
    applicability is highly narrow and specific.
