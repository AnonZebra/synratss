#' This package was used at KIND for analyzing and visualizing synesthesia
#' consistency test data and has been deprecated.
#' You are now recommended to instead use the synr package, which can be
#' found at www.github.com/datalowe/synr.
#'
#' The main function is \code{consistency_scoring()}, which uses the other
#' functions in the package. It calculates consistency scores for data from
#' an online consistency test (see e.g. Rothen, Seth, Witzel, & Ward, 2013)
#' and produces plots for each data set/participant. You can also use the
#' \code{plot_syn_cons()} function on its own (it is otherwise called by the
#' \code{consistency_scoring()} function).
#'
#' This package was developed for use at the Center of
#' Neurodevelopmental Disorders at Karolinska Institutet (KIND). Its
#' applicability is highly narrow and specific.
